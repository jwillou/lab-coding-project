# lab-coding-project
**Overall goal:** 

Write a functioning individual (or agent) based model. This should be a basic model that starts with 100 individuals and maintains roughly this population size over 50 years; some variation is good, but you donâ€™t want a wildly fluctuating population size. Both sexes are capable of reproducing after 1 year, and offspring litter/clutch/brood size is 1 individual per year. No individuals live past 3 years. Your code should output the total population size, sex ratio, and number of newborns each year to a text file of some kind. Also, your code should be in a repository on GitHub, along with a readme that outlines how to run your code.

**Weekly plan:**

[Week 1 - 5/26/2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MpcguxjFwT5Bv7KckISZbuC1DRJfWuMV7lNdbCchxSs/edit "Week 1")
- install R, R studio, github Desktop
- talk about model structure/function
- think and talk about how the model will actually run

Week 2 - 6/23/2021
- Postponed so we can all enjoy Evolution online conference!

[Week 2 revisited - 6/30/2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JTtMAVYZojaqNjwhNQpmcCGWf6fK2IFJC3Kc67tRgJo/edit "Week 2")
- basic setup (working directory, declaring variables)
- initializing the population
- setting up a simple loop
- if we have time: functions/subroutines

[Week 3 - 7/7/2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E8AqqE7EAQ_t5E9xP5fODRYYu598BXksI_kAjcDQ6e0/edit "Week 3")
- script/output organization
- functions/subroutines
- sourcing functions

[Week 4 - 7/14/2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZsiLGxVN7Oih46p2gQc_LBiq2bmLPrzAvKfD3Asl7ro/edit "Week 4")
